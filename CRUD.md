## Inserting data ##

A reference to the entity object is required, along with the entity itself:

```
val jp = new JobPosition("Developer")
val inserted = mapperDao.insert(JobPositionEntity, jp)
// inserted equals to jp. jp must not be used for subsequent operations
// Depending on the mappings, inserted might contain auto-generated data,
// usually an autogenerated id

// prints the id and the value of the inserted entity
println("%d : %s",inserted.id,inserted)
 
```

Please note that mapperDao.insert returns a new instance of the entity. The old instance must not be used for further mapperDao operations, `inserted` should be used instead.

If the entity has auto-generated id's, then `inserted` will contain extra properties to read those:
```
println("%d : %s",inserted.id,inserted)
```

## Updating data ##

There are 2 ways to update data.

### Updating mutable entities ###

Mutable entities can be changed and updated as follows:

```
val jp = new JobPosition(5, "Developer", date, date, 10)
val inserted = mapperDao.insert(JobPositionEntity, jp)

// update
inserted.name = "Scala Developer"
inserted.rank = 7
val updated = mapperDao.update(JobPositionEntity, inserted)
// updated now contains a new instance of the updated
// entity and should be used for further operations 

```

### Updating immutable entities ###

Since immutable entities can't change, a new instance with the modifications should be passed on to mapperDao:

```
val jp = new JobPosition(5, "Developer", date, date - 2.months, 10)
val inserted = mapperDao.insert(JobPositionEntity, jp)

val updated=mapperDao.update(JobPositionEntity, inserted, new JobPosition(5, "Developer Changed", date, date, 5))
// updated now contains a new instance of the updated
// entity and should be used for further operations 
```

## Selecting entities ##

Just pass the entity and id (or id's) to mapperdao:

```
val selected=mapperDao.select(JobPositionEntity, 5)
```

## Deleting entities ##

Just pass the entity and value to mapperdao:

```
mapperDao.delete(JobPositionEntity, selected)
```

## Creating DAO's for your entities ##

So far we worked straight with mapperdao, but for bigger projects, daos should be created for each entity, please see [best practices for creating dao](CRUDDaos.md)
