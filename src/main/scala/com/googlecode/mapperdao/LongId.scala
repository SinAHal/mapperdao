/**
 * Classes (mutable or immutable) with long id's can mix this trait so that the id can be accessed when required.
 * Note that the id is not part of a domain model but rather part of the database. So a clean domain model class doesn't
 * have to provide access to it's id. But when the entity is loaded from the database, then it becomes
 * a T with LongId.
 *
 * For nested entities, use mapperDao.longIdFor(o) or Helpers.longIdFor(o)
 * to access the id of an entity.
